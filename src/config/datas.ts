      'St. Mary‚Äôs School came into being on 1st April, 2005 under the aegis of St. Jude‚Äôs Social and Educational Charitable Society. Mr. Benjamin Mathew, a renowned educationist and a visionary with a vast experience of more than 45 years in the field of education is the person behind this venture. He really felt the need to provide quality education to the children in and around Fatehgarh Sahib in Punjab, as educational facilities in the area had not developed in proportion to the phenomenal growth of the town‚Äôs population. He envisages to nurture this institution from a modest beginning to glorious heights catering to the intellectual needs of the people of this region. The main focus of the school is to disseminate wholesome education to all deserving students without any consideration of caste, creed, religion or  sex, so that the pupils develop a harmonious and all-round personality through their physical, intellectual, aesthetic and moral growth. Utmost care is taken to help the pupil become a good member of the family, a good citizen and a productive member of the Society.',
